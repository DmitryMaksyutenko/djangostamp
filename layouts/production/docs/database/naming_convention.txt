General
- Use the unique names that not exists as reserved keywords in SQL of DBSM.
- Names begins with the letter.
- Names consists of letters, numbers, underscores.
- Avoid abbreviations.
- Use the snake case style.
- Do not use the prefixes.
- All keywords names in uppercase.


Databases
- Name start with the capital letter.


Tables
- Use the lower case letters.
- Name must be a noun.
- Never give a table the same name as one of its columns and vice versa.


Columns
- Use the lower case letters.
- Name must be a noun.
- Use the singular name.
- Avoid using "id" as the primary identifier for the table.
- Do not add a column with the same name as its table and vice versa.


Aliasing or correlations
- Should relate in some way to the object or expression they are aliasing.
- As a rule of thumb the correlation name should be the first letter of each word in the object’s name.
- If there is already a correlation with the same name then append a number.
- Always include the AS keyword—makes it easier to read as it is explicit.
- For computed data (SUM() or AVG()) use the name as it's like a column defined in the schema.


Stored procedures
- The name must contain a verb.
- The name in uppercase.


Indentatin
- Base two spaces.
- Joins, subqueries with four spaces.


Choosing data types
- Where possible do not use vendor-specific data types—these are not portable
    and may not be available in older versions of the same vendor’s software.
- Only use REAL or FLOAT types where it is strictly necessary for floating point
    mathematics otherwise prefer NUMERIC and DECIMAL at all times.
    Floating point rounding errors are a nuisance!


Keys
- Must be unique.
- Sequenced keys preferred.



Constraints
- Constraints should be defined directly beneath the column they correspond to.
    Indent the constraint so that it aligns to the right of the column name.
- If it is a table-level constraint that applies to the entire table then it should also appear at the end.
